Short Write up:
- What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
  - This project is using HTML/CSS(SCSS), React(Create React App), Bootstrap Grid system. 
  - The project is hosted on GitHub pages.
  - I am using shell script to build file structure for deployment.
- Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose
  - Animation was a little bit struggling since there was no specific requirement and I personally don't like to abuse animations so it took me some time to decide on what kind of animation to use.
- What you enjoyed the most and why
  - I enjoy setting up variables in SCSS and using them. I also start doing this in my own project which is really helpful when project grow big.
  - I enjoy building my own carousel. Although the transition is not as I wanted it because of the time limit but I would continue building it and make it better.
